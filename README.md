# Hey, I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 23-year-old coder who loves building things that make life easier and more efficient. I specialize in **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **C#**. Whether it's optimizing Windows PCs, creating Zen Script tools, or automating account generation, Iâ€™m all about making things run smoothly.

## ðŸš€ What I Build

- **Zen Script Tools**: For the gamers and coders, I develop tools to enhance your experience with Zen Scripts.
- **Automated Account Generators**: I build scripts that automate account creation to save you time and effort.
